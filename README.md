# SearchTwitch
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

A simple search using the Twitch v5 search API in a snazzy looking interface.

You can hover over cards to preview the stream in the page. It also now has routing, so you can save, share, and bookmark your favorite searches.
