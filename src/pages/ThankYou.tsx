            <p>Unfortunately, I haven't had the time to devote to this project, nor the passion to really continue much hobby dev work. I know the site's been broken for a while, and I hope that I can bring it back in some form eventually, but for now, if you're looking for an alternative, might I suggest CommanderRoot's <a href="https://twitch-tools.rootonline.de/channel_previews.php" rel="noopener">Twitch stream filter</a>.</p>
            <p>Thank you to all of you who used and enjoyed the tool. It's been amazing to see the support people have given this.</p>
            <p>If you're interested in getting in touch about the project, feel free to contact me on <a href="https://twitch.tv/caffeinewriter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/caffeinewriter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a>, or via email at caff / caffeinewriter / com (replace the slashes with an @ and a .)</p>
            <p>For now, so long, and thanks for all the fish.</p>
